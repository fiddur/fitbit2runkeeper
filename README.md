Fitbit â†’ Runkeeper syncer
==========================

This program will, when more ready, take activities in Runkeeper and add
heartrate series from Fitbit (e.g. HR or Surge).

This project requires both Fitbit and Runkeeper API keys, and is using a fitbit
api beta feature that might be broken in the future:
https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/activity/#get-activity-logs-list

This is Work In Progress, but can export a fitbit activity to runkeeper,
currently tried (successfully) with runs that have GPS and heart rate as well
as auto-tracked "Sports" activity.


Install and run
---------------

To get this to work you need Fitbit personal API or partner API, otherwise you can't get intraday
heart rate series.

```bash
npm install

FITBIT_CLIENTID=... \
FITBIT_SECRET=... \
FITBIT_VERIFICATIONCODE=... \
RUNKEEPER_CLIENTID=... \
RUNKEEPER_SECRET=... \
SERVER_HOST=example.net \
SERVER_PORT=3000 \
SERVER_PROTOCOL=http \
PORT=3000 \
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://user:pass@example.net/fitbit2runkeeper \
COOKIE_SECRET=secret \
npm start
```


Usage right now
---------------

* Visit localhost.
* Connect both fitbit and runkeeper.
* List subscriptions to activate automatic sync.
* Click the fitbit activity's logId to export it to runkeeper.


Todo
----

* Don't mark every km as pause/resume just because fitbit makes laps of them.
* Make subscription automatic on first fitbit auth.
* Factor out authentication from `app.js`
