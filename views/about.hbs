<p>
  This is a hobby project to sync Fitbit activities to Runkeeper.  It
  will automatically sync ALL your fitbit activities, from tracker, manual and
  auto-detected.  (Someday that might be a setting, if that would be
  interestingâ€¦).
</p>

<p>
  To stop the sync, just go to Fitbit account settings and revoke access for
  "ActivitySyncer".

<p>
  If you find any problems, report them
  <a href="https://github.com/fiddur/fitbit2runkeeper/issues">on the Github repository</a>
  and I will look into it when I get time.  This project is done solely on my spare time and
  is run on a free plan on <a href="http://herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>, so don't
  expect too much.
